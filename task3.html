<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<u>
Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 [21] [22][23][24] to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin maharastrian famiy[25][26][27] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[28] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[29][30]

Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[31]

He also showed interest in Tennis, idolising John McEnroe. When he was 7 to 8 years, he was a fan of McEnroe and his love for Tennis was on equal level of Cricket, as per him it was time whether I play Tennis or play cricket. That time he had grown long hairs like McEnroe and use to wear wrist bands and head bands like his Tennis hero and use to carry Tennis racket wherever go.[32][33][34]

To help curb his mischievous, bullying tendencies, Ajit Tendulkar, his elder brother introduced Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the Sachin did not able to play his best game. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[35][better source needed] Ajit Tendulkar also had experience of playing cricket in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[36]

Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[22] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[37] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[38] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[39] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[37]


Sachin Tendulkar and his wife Anjali
Meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield.[40] Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga Cricket League,[37] and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India (CCI).[41] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[42] On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India.[43] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's "Best Junior Cricketer Award" (He was 14 years that time). "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.[44][45] Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.[46][47] In his season[clarification needed] in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played.[citation needed] He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.[48] This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.
